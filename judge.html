                                There’s not much Gregg Wallace doesn’t know about food. In his twelve years as co-judge on MasterChef, Celebrity MasterChef and MasterChef: The Professionals, he has tasted over 10,000 dishes!
                                Born in Peckham, London, Gregg began his career in Covent Garden Fruit and Veg Market. In 1989 he started George Allan’s Greengrocers, a company that built up to an eventual turnover of £7.5 million.            
                                On the back of this success, he was invited to co-present Veg Talk on BBC Radio 4 with Charlie Hicks and became the original presenter of Saturday Kitchen in 2002.
                                Renowned in particular for his love of puddings and humorous quips – not to mention a single in the top 40 charts – Gregg is now a familiar face on UK television screens. As well as MasterChef, he has presented numerous programmes such as Harvest, Eat Well for Less, Inside the Factory and Supermarket Secrets, and taken part in iconic series including Who Do You Think You Are? and Strictly Come Dancing.
                                As well as his media work, Gregg has fronted many successful high-profile media campaigns, and has for the past five years been an Ambassador for The Ideal Home Show. His autobiography, Life on a Plate, was published in 2012.                          </div>

                                John Torode has been a judge on MasterChef, Celebrity MasterChef and Junior MasterChef since 2005. With over 35 years of experience in the food industry, he couldn’t be better placed to offer contestants both honest feedback and support.
                            Australian-born John was first introduced to cooking by his grandmother. In 1992, he moved to London, to join the Conran Group, starting out at Pont de La Tour before becoming Sous Chef at Quaglino’s. By 1995, he was Head Chef of Mezzo in Soho; at the time one of Europe’s largest restaurants. From 1996 to 2000, he was the resident chef on ITV’s This Morning with Richard and Judy. Restaurant openings followed, first with Smiths of Smithfield in 2000, then The Luxe in 2009.
                            From his culinary road trip John Torode’s Australia to his Malaysian Adventure for the Good Food channel, John’s passion for food has seen him travel the globe exploring a diverse range of cuisines. He has championed beef both home and away in the Great British Food Revival and A Cook Abroad: John Torode’s Argentina for BBC2 .
                            A well-known food writer, John regularly contributes to publications such as Olive, BBC Good Food, Guardian and Observer. He has published numerous cookbooks, the most recent of which, My Kind Of Food: Recipes I Love to Cook at Home, was published in 2015.

                                Marcus Wareing has been a judge on MasterChef: The Professionals since 2014. With a string of awards including two Michelin stars, Tatler Restaurateur of the Year, GQ Chef of the Year, Chef of the Year with Caterer and Hotelkeeper and the Acorn Award, it is easy to understand why his opinion and restaurants are so respected.
                                Originally from Southport, Merseyside, the son of a fruit and vegetable merchant, Marcus began his career aged 18. He received his first Michelin star at just 26 – one of only a handful of chefs to be recognised at this age. Over the last 30 years Marcus has been involved in the creation of some of London’s most celebrated restaurants.
                                Founded in 2008 with his wife Jane, Marcus Wareing Restaurants began with the opening of the two-Michelin starred Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley – now known simply as ‘Marcus’. The group now includes The Gilbert Scott and Tredwells.
                                Other media work includes being chef consultant on the film Burnt, appearing on the BBC programme Chef vs Science and other prime time UK TV cookery shows. In September 2016, Marcus published his sixth cookbook, ‘Marcus at Home’, with Harper Collins.
                                Marcus is a supporter of The Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation, Action Against Hunger, Street Smart, GOSH, MENCAP, Help for Heroes, The British Red Cross, One for the Boys and Cancer Research. He lives in London with his wife and three children.

                                The queen of eyebrow raising and of straight-talking feedback, Monica Galetti has been delighting audiences as a judge on MasterChef: the Professionals since 2009.
                                Born in Samoa and raised in New Zealand, an early interest in food led her to train in hospitality before moving to London in 1999 to work as a commis chef for Michel Roux Jr at Le Gavroche. Monica’s talent was soon recognised and she rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming the first female Sous Chef at the restaurant. In 2004 she helped launch, and became Head Chef of, Le Gavroche Tropiques in Mauritius.
                                Following the birth of her daughter, Anais, Monica returned to London and continued working at La Gavroche until 2015 when she left to spend some time with her family and focus on finding a site for her first restaurant venture.
                                In early 2017, she and her husband David (previously head sommelier at Le Gavroche) opened Mere in Charlotte Street London, using classical French with South Pacific influences. The name (pronounced like Meredith) was chosen in memory of Monica’s mother.
                                As well as being a chef, restauranteur and television personality, Monica is also the author of two books (Monica’s Kitchen, published in 2012, and The Skills, published in 2016) and a regular speaker at food festivals.
                                A 6-part television series, Amazing Hotels: Life beyond the Lobby, hosted by Monica and Giles Coren was aired in March 2017.
